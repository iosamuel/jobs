# Work at Nodejitsu

Hi javascripters, I've been on the development since I have 8 years old, since there I learn 'old-school' technologies, but when I discover JS, I can't stop learn and learn this fabulous technology.

I like share knowledge to all, because that, I'm staff of some comunities over internet like Autodidact.as and Desarrolloweb.com and recently AFK comunities like MedellinJS in my city.

Actually work with the Colombia Government teaching in all the country, you can see me [here](http://bootcamps.apps.co/equipo.php) (I'm Samuel Burbano Ramos) I teach JavaScript and Python.

My interests to work with you is that you are a company that are aporting very much innovating things that are moving all the world in the way we develop Javascript and I want to be part of all of this!

Some of the things that I develop are:

* [souch](https://npmjs.org/package/souch) This is a npm package, as you can see, and is a very simple client to work with couchdb. I'm implmenting this in freelance projects like [this chat](http://web.es-ya.co:8080/)
* [botnob](https://npmjs.org/package/botnob) A very simple npm package that performs a while loop of asynchronous way (without blocking the rest of processes)
* [my github](https://github.com/iosamuel) All my repos and the sources of the two projects meaned above, and another things like a CRUD using SOUCH.

I have not much experience, but I have knowledge and I have much desire to innovate, create and share working with you.
